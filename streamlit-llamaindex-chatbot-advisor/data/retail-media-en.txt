Retail Media

Unleash the full potential of your brand and trade marketing partners through innovative digital advertising strategies for retail media with adlicious. Our unique formats transform digital impressions into physical interactions at the point-of-sale:

Dynamic DOOH: Increase sales and create new touchpoints for your weekly offers. Use personalized messages dynamically placed in public areas and strategically located near your retail stores.

Display flyer ads with drive-to-store: Turn your analog print flyers into digital flyer ads with Google Maps integration to drive customers to your stores for more footfall traffic. In addition to offers from promotional weeks, individual products – such as product launches – can also be effectively promoted through a mix of video and drive-to-store integration. Alternatively, flyer ads can be used to drive customers directly to your online store and push sales.

YouTube/CTV: From analog prospects to aesthetic animated videos – with our CTV flyer ads you can reach your target audience directly on TV in the living room via bumper and instream ads.
