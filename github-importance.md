3. Documentation: GitHub can be used to store documentation for your projects. This is a great way to keep track of your project’s requirements, design, and implementation.
4. Hosting: GitHub can also be used to host your projects. This means you can make your code available to others to view and download.
5. Free: GitHub is free to use, and you can keep your repositories public or private. If you need more resources, you can opt for a paid plan and check out https://github.com/pricing.
