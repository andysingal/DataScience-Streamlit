# DataScience-Streamlit

**Day1 of MachineLearningDeepLearning**
- On my Journey of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, I have been reading about History of Deep Learning, Image Fundamentals, Pixels, Scaling and Aspect Ratios, Image Classification, Semantic Gap, Feature Extraction, Viewpoint Variation, Scale Variation, Deformation, Occlusions, Illumination, Background Clutter, Intra-class Variation, Supervised and Unsupervised Learning and few more topics related to the same. I have presented the notes about Image Classification, Semantic Gap, Feature Extraction, Supervised and Unsupervised Learning here in the snapshot. I hope you will also spend some time learning the topics from the Book mentioned below. Excited about the days ahead !!
- Book:
  - Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python
